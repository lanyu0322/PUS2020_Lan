# PUS2020_Lan



Here is a little bit background about me. My name is Lan Yu. Please feel free to call me Lan. I am a second-year Ph.D. student and major in energy and environment policy. My research interest is the implementation of big data and machine learning in policy area, especially in energy and environment area. Both of my bachelor and master degree are public administration. Before I came to the university of Delaware, I worked in Tongji University as urban planner and in charge of Icity program(http://icity.ikcest.org/). 

What I expect to learn from the class: I have some python experience but it is not enough. I want to learning more coding, statistical analysis, and visualization skills, especially how to use these skills in public policy area.
